simple, drop any old ruby file in here and it will be loaded after the main window is set up



To add a tile:
make a class that extends Tile
before initialize, override @name with your tiles full name
def initalize (x, y, angle)
super
@image = your texture (for example Gosu::Image.new("textures/debug.png", {retro: true}),   all textures should use retro, and be 32x32 pixels)


after this, call the newTile command and give it your class name (actual class name, not @name) and your prefered image, and add true after if your tile is rotateable
done!



options:
@angle = angle to allow rotating your tile, dont forget to make your build image rotate and make sure to set solid edges correctly!
mark which parts of your tile is solid by setting @sup @sdown @sleft or @sright to true 
mark how your tile can use wire by setting @wup @wdown @wleft or @wright to true 
set @w to true to activate wireing and allow conection, at runtime or when tile is created
set @dwire to false to not draw default wireing
you can override @wcore and @wire images to custom ones while still using default wire draw code (generators and storage units use a blank wire core and short wire! textures/blank.png and textures/wireSlantShort.png)
set @dboarders to false to not draw boarders where not solid
