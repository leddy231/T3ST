# Welcome to Tile Space Shit Simulator Thing!
This is a simple hobby game writen in Ruby. There is not much to do yet...

It requires [Gosu](https://github.com/gosu/gosu) to run.

´´´gem install gosu´´´

Then simply run the launcher

´´´ruby Launcher.rb´´´

Or just run the main file if you dislike fullscreen

´´´ruby Main.rb´´´

Controls

WASD, Space to shoot, B to build, Esc for menu. 

Press F in the menu for alterantive flying mode, Press D for Infinte Energy and Blocks.


No lincense here, you are free to steal whatever you want (Except the name, I kinda like it).
